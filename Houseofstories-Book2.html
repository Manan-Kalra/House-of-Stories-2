                    Kevin was a curious boy who loved science. He was always eager to learn new things and try out new experiments. He had been looking forward to the day when they would finally get to make their own scientific, magic liquid for days. He spent hours with his friends, Ben, James, and Shelly, brainstorming ideas about what they should make. They considered making a liquid that could make your hair longer than your body or something that could make you as big as a skyscraper. They finally decided that they would create a liquid that would make anything it spilled on five centimetres tall. They thought this would be perfect for shrinking the vegetable they all hated the most- broccoli!

                    Kevin was so excited that he woke up early in the morning and quickly finished his breakfast so he could get on the school bus and head to school. The first thing they had on the schedule was maths, which was Kevin's second-favourite subject after science. They were learning about decimals, which their maths teacher, Mr. David, said were essential if they wanted to become anything, whether it was a doctor or a scientist. Kevin paid very close attention during maths class because he wanted to be a scientist when he grew up.
                    Science was the next thing on the schedule, and Kevin was keenly watching the clock for when the bell would ring. Finally, Ding Dong! The bell had rung, and Kevin, Ben, James, and Shelly (The awesome scientists, as they called themselves) went to the science lab. However, they were disappointed to find that their teacher, Miss Kate, was nowhere to be seen! They looked around everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. The substitute teacher, Mr. King, sadly informed them that their planned activities for the day would be postponed. The only bright side was that they would get a longer lunch break. Kevin was disappointed and went to the lunch counter to get some food from the lunch lady. He tried to cheer himself up by reminding himself that tomorrow was another day. He took the bus home and did his after-school daily routine before going to bed, dreaming about tomorrow.

                    The next morning, Kevin woke up early and had his cereal before quickly getting on the school bus. They had science class just before lunch like they did yesterday. They did maths first and then science. Kevin crossed his fingers and prayed that they would get to do yesterday's activity, and to his relief, their teacher, Miss Kate, was present! She said they could immediately start their project. The “awesome scientists” got to work on their project, and they were having a lot of fun. They mixed different chemicals, and before they knew it, they had created the magic liquid.
                    But then, something unexpected happened. Ben reached over to get a napkin to clean his hands and accidentally spilled the liquid on Kevin! In less than two seconds, Kevin was as small as five centimeters!
                    Kevin didn't know what to do. He screamed out for Miss Kate, but she couldn't hear him. He ran as fast as he could to go through the door, and because he was the fastest runner in the class, he made it. But now what would he do? He went out to the street, and the cars that were racing down the street seemed like giants! He tried to move, but every time he did, another car would speed past him. They never stopped! Suddenly, he heard a loud buzzing sound. When he looked, he saw a giant bee. Before he wasn't afraid of bees or other insects, but now, as he was five centimeters tall, he didn't have anything to do but to fear. The bee came and suddenly grabbed him and took him to its beehive.

                <center><img src="depositphotos_34532185-stock-photo-3d-small-people-tall-ruler.jpg" height="400"/></center>
                <p>
                    Now he was trapped in the beehive outside of their school. He thought to himself that he would have to stay there and then secretly creep out in the morning to go to school. It was nighttime now, so Kevin gathered some honey and made a bed for himself. He soon fell asleep and woke up in the morning. He walked to the school, which took almost half an hour, as he was so small. When he entered school, it was science class. When he walked to the lab, Ben was standing there. He picked up Kevin, put him on the table, and said that he was very sorry. Kevin sighed and said it was okay. Ben said that to say sorry, he had made a liquid that would make anything that had shrunk back to normal size. Kevin was so happy. Ben put a few drops of the liquid on Kevin, and within seconds he was back to his normal size. Kevin hugged Ben and said thank you.
                    Now this story has a happy ending, and Kevin learned that even when things don't go as planned, there is always a way to make things right. He continued to be curious and eager to learn more about science, and he never forgot the lesson he learned about the importance of being patient and never giving up.
