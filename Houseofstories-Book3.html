                    Once upon a time, lived a pack of geese. I was the youngest one of these and everybody cared for me. Beside our pond, there was a very kind family. They cared for Canadian geese like myself.
                    Time for migration was approaching. It was starting to get colder in Canada and warmer in the southern areas. We had one day until it was the perfect time for migrating. Me and my family had decided we would take our leave in the morning.
                    It was starting to get dark outside. My family was getting ready for sleep. And so was I. We had to get ready for tomorrow. It will be a long day.

                    The next day, A stroke of sunlight hit my feathers and that is when I knew when to wake up. Or at least, I thought it was. When I opened my eyes and looked around, nobody was there. I looked to my left and then I looked to my right, but nobody was there. I started to get worried. “Oh no,” I thought as I moved around, “if my family isn’t here, how will I get to the south and find them?” Tears started to flow down my cheeks.
                    Suddenly, I saw some creatures come toward me. When I looked closely, it turned out to be the family who lived beside us. Watching their moves, I came to learn that they had come out for their evening stroll. I tried to grab their attention and tried to make them come to me, and sure enough, it worked! This family was a friend of mine, so they understood. Dave, the father of the kids, said that unfortunately they didn’t know how to help. And on saying this, they left and continued their walk. I started to get worried. I looked up and noticed that it was getting dark. “Already?” I thought to myself. I built a small nest of old wood and slept. I would have to start my journey tomorrow.
                    The next day arrived with heavy rain, as it fell upon my feathers. The plan for the day would have to be cancelled and postponed to the following day.
                    Luckily, on the next day, the weather was perfectly fine and I decided that this would be the day for his adventure. I opened my wings, (which weren't too big, after all) flapped them and took my leave. And from here, my adventure started.
                    Along the way, I met many creatures. My first encounter was with a big eagle. It didn’t seem too kind, and so I didn’t stand back to chat around with him. The second thing I saw was a big, metal cylinder, which had two pairs of wings and a fan on each side. I wasn’t sure what it is called but I think people call it an airplane. The last thing I saw was a big bird. This one was actually one of my friends. It was a swan. I am actually glad I met the swan because he said some really pleasant words. He said that he had seen his family and told me where they had landed. He said they were currently resting in northern Mexico. I thanked my friend and continued my journey.
                    I finally reached the destination and met my family. I was very happy and everybody lived happily ever after.
