                    On one stormy night, David was watching the news. He had heard of many strange space adventures before, but never something like what he was seeing now. What am I talking about? You guessed it right! He was just watching the live news about the mission to planet Olika, an unknown planet somewhere in outer space. As David and his family lived in a city called Diamondville, their city needed a big diamond jewel, (and by big, I mean a 7 feet square big diamond). The problem was that the Olika aliens had stolen it overnight, when nobody was watching. Diamondville could not last for more than three weeks without that gem of power (we’ll call it gem, for short). However, the biggest problem was the creatures living on planet Olika. Once, scientists sent out a satellite to land on the planet Mars but it landed on the unknown planet at the time (Olika). What the scientists noticed was ugly, three-eyed creatures, and I can’t explain more about how ugly they look. That is why nobody, not even the strongest astronaut, dared to go. So David decided to go. He decided to go in the morning. So he slept dreaming about his adventure.

                    The next morning, when he woke up, he told his parents about his plan. Instead of being worried, they were proud and confident that their son was going on an adventure to outer space. He went to the space academy and borrowed a rocket. He went to the launching pad, learned how to take off and land eagerly and quickly (for he was a fast learner) and took off in no time.
                    An hour later he was in outer space, out of Earth’s atmosphere and used the radar to find where planet Olika was. He used all the sensors, cameras, and radars he knew on the rocket, but planet Olika was nowhere to be found. Suddenly a call sign came on one of the screens of the rocket. When he picked it up, it was the astronauts who were calling him down from Earth. They told him to use the top radar which was on the highest level by pressing the blue button. When he did so, he could see planet Olika as clearly as ever. He thanked the scientists and disconnected the call. He then landed on the planet Olika a week later. When he stepped on the planet, it was very slimy. He went back in and got his big boots. The boots weren’t perfect, but they were better than walking with sneakers. He climbed out of the rocket and started his journey on planet Olika.

                    As he started walking, in the distance he saw something that looked like a modern city! As he headed to it, something seized his astronaut suit by its belt. When he spun around to investigate what it was, he couldn’t believe what he’d seen. It was an Olika monster! The monster muttered some inarticulate sounds that were inaudible to David. I think that if you saw an unknown monster that had three red-eyes and a 2 feet wide mouth, you would be afraid. However, David was totally unafraid. The first thing he did was say hello to the ugly monster and surprisingly, so did the monster. The monster asked him his name, to which David replied correctly. The monster then sniffed David out, telling him that he was one of the guards on planet Olika. He also said that he was the nicest guard on planet Olika and if he went to any other guard, they wouldn’t allow him to enter. However, he was letting him go because he knew he wouldn’t do any harm to them. David then continued his adventure and went to the gate of the city apparently being called Diamond City. There he saw aliens called ‘gate protectors.’ They were two grumpy looking aliens who wouldn’t let him go inside. Oh, and before I continue on with the story, I wanted to tell you that these creatures didn’t have good eyesight. Remembering this, David turned around, went back to his rocket and changed into his alien halloween costume, which looked exactly like the aliens, and tried again.  Believe it or not, it actually worked! The grumpy aliens let him inside the city. As soon as they opened the big gate door, a large light shone on him. When he looked to see what it was, it was the diamond! He stepped inside and walked his journey further down Diamond city. He met many ugly looking creatures along his way. He stopped by one of them and asked them where the king of the city was. The alien didn’t understand David. He told him to the ‘translator alien’ in his alienese language but luckily, David understood.</p><p>When he went to the translator and asked him the same question, he answered that he was in the palace. David walked towards the big castle. He saw the king’s servants on every single step of the royal staircase. They played a big tuba horn, which was a signal to call the king. David wondered how the king would go down the- he counted up all the stairs- down the five-thousand stairs. The king then came marching down. Somebody had thrown a banana peel on the second step and when the king stepped on the banana peel, whoosh, down he came tumbling. It took him a whole Earth day for him to come down the stairs. This time, the aliens got so bored that they got some cards to play with to keep themselves entertained. Oh, and just to remind you, two weeks of his three-week adventure had been over. Soon, after a short period of time, the king finally reached his destination (the end of the staircase). David then said hello to the king.</p><p> The king replied and asked him who he was and what he came for. David said that he was from the planet Earth and he had come to take the diamond back. The king was kind so he said that he would love to but that they needed a mascot for their city. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, David was a very good artist. David said that if they gave their diamond, he would draw a really beautiful, 3D diamond. The king gathered all his people and had a small discussion. They had a vote and 50 people voted to keep it and 51 people decided to give it away. So David took the diamond and drew a diamond like he had promised. He then said goodbye and got back into his spacecraft, but it wouldn’t start! The guard didn’t know this but he gave a big gasoline can as a “return gift.” David was really happy. He had thought that he would be stuck on planet Olika. He then turned on the rocket jets and soon left for home. Within an hour he reached back to Earth. He got off the rocket and walked proudly with the diamond in his hand. He gave the diamond to the mayor, who put the diamond in its place and even added a laser layer to protect the diamond. Nobody wanted this incident to happen again. David went home and enjoyed the rest of the day with his parents. He was very happy. The next day his parents said they had a present for him. They told him to go into the garage and lift up the sheet that was hiding something. When he did, he saw a big bicycle! He hugged and thanked his parents for the wonderful surprise. And now, the story has ended with a very, very, very happy ending.</p>
